Due to the ever-growing demand of energy, the levels of CO2 and other harmful gases has
led to an alarming situation, which calls for an alternate solution. The shift towards Electric
vehicles (EV) is a great step towards a better environment. The reserves of fossils are
depleting at an all-time highest rate. Hence, sustainable resources of energy are the best
choice for a better future. The public acceptance of EVs and their large-scale deployment
requires a fully functional charging infrastructure. Currently, India does not have a largescale
infrastructure for the implementation of EVs.
Thatâ€™s where Intelligent Infrastructure Planning for Electrical Vehicles comes in - a
machine learning model that can accurately predict the best locations to implement electric
vehicle charging stations in Columbus, Ohio and Chandigarh, India.
